           USERS AND GROUP MANAGEMENT IN LINUX 
PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT

1.	LOCAL UBUNTU 
2.	REMOTE UBUNTU
User management  Important Directories
1.	/etc/passwd    [ where details of users are stored ] 
               #     cat /etc/shadow 
#password and passwd 
2.	/etc/shadow    [ the hash password ] [ must be access with admin privileges
  #    sudo cat /etc/shadow 
      CREATING USERS/ADDING USERS ON THE LINUX SERVER
1.	Only root users can create or add users on a system = because they have super power
2.	Root users assume super power with the help of the [ sudo ] 
#  sudo apt install ncal    [ the calender ]
# sudo apt install tree 
# sudo apt  update ] 	
3.	How to Create Users on a system. 
a.	Create a user called felix   and assisgn  password
#   sudo  useradd   [username ] 
#   sudo  useradd    felix     [  and supply the required information ] 

NB:  The useradd create a user with no home directory
#   sudo  adduser  felixx      [ and supply the required information ] 
 
b.	Login using the felixx     password
To access another user’s account, we need the user’ password and permissions to do so. 
  Switching to another users account. 
The [su ]   [ switch user command] 
  #  su      -   felixx 

 

c.	Loggout from  felixx account
#  exit 
d.	 Assign Felix new password
            # sudo passwd  felixx 

 
	
3.	Create a user called Bantar  and add a comment/description to his as “new hr manager’”
    # sudo   adduser  -c “New Account Manager”  bantar	
4.	Create another user  called mumy and assign new password
  #    sudo adduser   mummy 
#      sudo passwd  mummy  [ to assign new password] 

 User and Group Management on Remote Servers   - AWS EC2 INSTANCE
1.	 Access your aws account and create a new ubuntu server. 
 

Our Instance property: 
A.	The instance ip address : 18.118.146.21
B.	PUBLIC IPV4 DNS: ec2-18-118-146-21.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
C.	The keypair : sept23 
D.	Default user:  ubuntu 


2.	Create a new keypair call sept23 
 


3.	Launch and access the server 
   Ssh client  =   local ubuntu 
1.	Open the local ubuntu and 
a.	Create a directory called .ssh or if it exist, then cd into the directory

#   cd   .ssh 


b.	Create a file called sept23.pem 
#  touch   sept23.pem
c.	Open the  content of the  file sept23.pem 
d.	Copy the content of the pem in your download folder and paste in the sept23.pem 
e.	Change/protect the file with [ chmod 400 setp23.pem] 
2.	Copy the content of the key sept23 to the local ubuntu
3.	Login into the server 
#  ssh   -I      ~/.ssh/sept23.pem  ubuntu@
4.	Enable password authentication
a.	#  sudo vi   /etc/ssh/sshd_config
b.	# change line 57 from no to yes 
c.	Restart the ssh service 

4.	Create users and grant them password authentication. 
a.	Grant access to the following users

5.	Isaac 
# ssh isaac@18.118.146.21    [ 2024] 
6.	Listing all users on the system 
#  ls /home 
7.	Remote login as the user banta
  #  ssh  banta@18.118.146.21 

How to delete user account on the system
1.	The userdel  command.

b.	The       /etc/gshadow         [ contains password hash ] 
 # sudo  cat  /etc/gshadow

c.	How to create groups  with the [ groupadd command] 
# sudo groupadd devops 
# sudo groupadd   employee 

 

How to add password to the group with the [ gpasswd]  command

2.	 #      sudo gpasswd   employees

How to remove password from group 
  #   sudo gpasswd  -r    devops 
#     sudo gpasswd   -r    employees 
   How to  create a group with specific   GID   [ group id ]
